- gatsby-source-filesystem (for static images)
- gatsby-transformer-sharp (for dynamic images)

### [gatsby-plugin-manifest](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-manifest/)

The web app manifest (part of the PWA specification) enabled by this plugin allows users to add your site to their home screen on most mobile browsers. The manifest provides configuration and icons to the phone.

### [gatsby-plugin-react-helmet](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet/)

### [gatsby-plugin-styled-components](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-styled-components/)

### [gatsby-plugin-react-svg](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-react-svg/)

Adds svg-react-loader to gatsby webpack config.

### [gatsby-plugin-offline](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-offline)

Adds drop-in support for making a Gatsby site work offline and more resistant to bad network connections. It uses Workbox Build to create a service worker for the site and loads the service worker into the client.

If youâ€™re using this plugin with gatsby-plugin-manifest (recommended) this plugin should be listed after that plugin so the manifest file can be included in the service worker.
